    This function corresponds to the process called "apical constriction"
    in the manuscript

    The cell undergoing delamination first contracts its apical
    area until it reaches a critical area, at which point it starts
    undergoing rearangements with its neighbors, performing
    successive type 1 transitions until the face has only 3 sides,
    when it disepears.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sheet : a :class:`tyssue.sheet` object
    manager : a :class:`tyssue.events.EventManager` object
    face_id : int
       the Id of the face undergoing delamination.
    contract_rate : float, default 2
       rate of increase of the face contractility.
    critical_area : float, default 1e-2
       face's area under which the cell starts loosing sides.
    radial_tension : float, default 1.
       tension applied on the face vertices along the
       apical-basal axis.
    nb_iteration : int, default 0
       number of extra iterations where the apical-basal force is applied
       between each type 1 transition
    contract_neighbors : bool, default `False`
       if True, the face contraction triggers contraction of the neighbor
       faces.
    contract_span : int, default 2
       rank of neighbors contracting if contract_neighbor is True. Contraction
       rate for the neighbors is equal to `contract_rate` devided by
       the rank.
